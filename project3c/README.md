Project 3C

Under tt-main/ use the folder named /project3c/ 

#### A continuation of Project 3b - Credit Card Form

You are required to save the form data to a database of your choice and create a new route where you can read the saved data and display to the user.

**Requirements**
- Save data to a database
- Read data from database

'NOTE: You can use any database and server technology of your choice. If you are not familiar with backend programming and databases, you can always use MongoDB as a more frontend'


**Data view route**
User should have the data displayed in a table format
User should have the ability to sort by Submitted Date, First Name, Last Name, CC Number and CC Provider

**Optional Tasks**
In data view route, add the ability to edit some user data:
- Update/Edit First name
- Update/Edit Last name
- Delete Record

**Security Considerations**
This exercise is intended to practice API access and hone your frontend skills. Please remember that any sensitive data should be handled appropriately in the backend and should not be saved as plain text.
The proper handling of sensitive data is beyond the scope of this exercise and all data entered on the form should be fake data, for testing purposes only.

**Drop-Dead Date: Monday 9 AM EST**
