3rd Project

Under your main folder, create a folder named /project3/ where your project 3 files will reside.
Note: Add the provided Readme and Style Guide files under project3/

Exercise:

In this project, you will create an interactive card details form to look as close as possible to design.
You should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiration date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- Make your site responsive for desktop and mobile views
- Add a nav bar with your Team Name centered (Feel free to add a logo for your Team at this point. It could be added on the top left-side of the bar - Not shown in Design)
- Add a footer with Start Time and End Time once completed and reviewed - Not shown in Design)

Once completed, you should expect the following:

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state

Use the provided style-guide.

Also, you are free to build it with any stack.

For this exercise, you will deploy your solution with Netlify.
Once completed, please provide in your groups: the link to your app, and the desktop and mobile screeenshots.
