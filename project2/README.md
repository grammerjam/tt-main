2nd Project

Under tt-main/ create a new folder called project2 and start your project there: one index.html file and styles.css file only.

Exercise:

The task of this project is to replicate a simple static landing page using HTML and CSS. You will receive a picture showing what your design should look like. Feel free to take creative liberty and use your own icons and pictures, but keep formatting the same.

Guidelines: Follow the design shown in the provided layout to display the text, buttons, and images. You are free to use any CSS methods that work for you, use semantic HTML and provide the highest quality code you can produce.

Footer: Add the following text, centered on page: "Start Date Time: XXXX XXXX" where XXXX XXXX is your Team's agreed Start date/time for this project. The next line will have the text: "End Date Time: XXXX XXXX" which you will update once your project is approved by a TL or PM.

Remember to feel free being as creative as you like with images, icons, etc. but formatting MUST remain the same.
